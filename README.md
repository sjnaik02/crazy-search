Crazy Search is a simple utility that allows you to search multiple search engines from a single place. It supports Google, GitHub, YouTube, Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets. By default, all searches are made through the Google search engine. To switch to another engine, simply type the name of the engine in the search bar and press the right arrow key. To go back to default, simply press backspace. The icon on the left will reflect what search engine is currently active, along with a prompt in the search bar.
